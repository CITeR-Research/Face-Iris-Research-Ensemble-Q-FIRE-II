Visible, NIR, and LWIR image sequences collected at varying distances and quality. Collected at Clarkson University. Funded by the CITeR and National Science Foundation.  Please see links below for additional details.

This biometric dataset collection contains data of three biometric modalities and multiple sensors:

--NIR Face and Iris

--Visible Face

--LWIR Face

--Voice Recording

The purpose of this data collection protocol is to develop a multi-biometric database which includes iris and face quality images, along with voice for varying distances, a range of quality, and natural behavior.

To produce non-uniformity in the dataset, a set of activities are used to facilitate natural subject behavior during data capture. At each distance, three different sets of data are captured.

The first scenario is cooperative, where the subject follows specific instructions from the collector, including looking straight at the camera; off-angle iris gaze, where the subject turns eyes left, right, up, and down at specific markers, while keeping head straight; off-angle face, where the subject turns whole head left, right, up, and down at specific markers; walking through a portal while looking straight ahead; and exhibiting various facial expressions, including angry, sad, and happy.

The second scenario is non-cooperative, where the subject is allowed to act more naturally. The activities in this set include interacting conversationally with the collector and addressing various objects around the room; waiting in line, where an object is passed forward in a line of people and the line rotates; and finally, a brief period of time where no instructions are given and the subject waits.

The dataset includes 84 subjects, with 44 of the subjects returning for a second visit. The data for each subject includes visible face videos, LWIR (thermal) face videos, and iris/face videos (saved as still frames).
